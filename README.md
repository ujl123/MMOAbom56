# MMOAbom56
WIP board for the MMOAbom56, a board ostensibly for playing mmo games.
The board technically works as-is, but build at your own risk and all that.

Followed the guide on https://flatfootfox.com/ergogen-introduction/ and was able to complete this in a few hours , well written guide with a lot of details.

If you do want to fab and print this ...  
The pcb files can be found in MMOAbom56/pcbs/gerber/.   
The stl files for is in MMOAbom56/case/  
The firmware can be found in firmware/compiled  

You will also need

1x rp2040 pro micro mcu (the firmware assumes rp2040, if not you will need to edit the pins to atmega pin names)  
2x male header sockets
2x female header sockets
7x flat m2 screw
7x m2 threaded inserts
56x chocv1 switches of your choice  
56x chocv1 keycaps  
56x chocv1 hotswap sockets  
56x 1N4148 smd diode (through hole) or 1N4148 SOD-123 (smd)
1x (optional) reset butto (find a small one as the gap between the case and pcb is very small.)
