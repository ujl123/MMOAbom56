# MMOAbom56
WIP board for the MMOAbom56, a board ostensibly for playing mmo games.
The board technically works as-is, but build at your own risk and all that.

If you do want to fab and print this ...
The pcb files can be found in MMOAbom56/pcbs/gerber/. 
The stl files for is in MMOAbom56/case/
The firmware can be found in firmware/compiled

You will also need

1x rp2040 pro micro mcu (the firmware assumes rp2040, if not you will need to edit the pins to atmega pin names)  
1x reset butto (find a small one as the gap between the case and pcb is very small.)
56x chocv1 switches of your choice  
56x chocv1 keycaps  
56x chocv1 hotswap sockets  
56x 1N4148 smd diode (through hole) or 1N4148 SOD-123 (smd)
